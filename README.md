1. also for lab 6, I did not hard code the table, I used js and read from a csv file. I hope that this is ok.  

#### Lab 7 - A web-based spreadsheet program: Dynamic Content (Assignment 7)
1. All Other Files are lab 7 
1. I used Ajax jqurey from [here](https://github.com/kermattC/Lab-Demos-CSCI3230U/blob/D3-and-Ajax/scripts/barChartAndAjax.js) this is an example from TA: Matt's thursday lab channel in CSCI 3230U slack.  
1. I also using the grades.csv file provided from TA: Matt (from slack) since the other csv has the grades for everything /10 instead of /100, which is just midterm & final exam 
1. I used the following command ```python3 -m http.server 8000``` in the `spreadsheet_prog/` directory to have a python3 server running on port 8000 on localhost. That is how `grades.csv` is accessed.
